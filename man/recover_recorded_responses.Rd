\title{Recover the Recorded Responses Given that Ranking Items were Randomized}
\usage{
recover_recorded_responses(presented_order, true_order, df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{presented_order}{A string representing the order of the items that
were presented to the respondent.}

\item{true_order}{A string representing the true order of the items, i.e.,
with respect to the reference choice set.}

\item{df}{The input data frame. Defaults to NULL.
If NULL, the function expects inputs as simple strings such as "321" or
"312".}
}
\value{
A data frame with the true ranking of the items per respondent.
}
\description{
This function, using the order of the items that was presented to the
respondent as well as the true responses to the ranking question,
recovers the recorded responses, or the responses that the respondent
actually provided, ignoring the order in which the items were
presented.
}
\details{
This is to see if behavior such as diagonalization occurred.
Most survey software will take the recorded response and translate it into
the true ranking of the respondent (observed ranking),
but not providing the recorded response.

For example, given a reference choice set of three items, A, B, and C,
the respondent may have been presented with the items in the order
C, B, A, and may have responded with 3-2-1 as a recorded response.
The true order of the items is A, B, C, so the observed/true ranking is
1-2-3. This function takes C, B, A and 1-2-3 as inputs and returns 3-2-1.

\examples{
recover_recorded_responses("321", "123") ## outputs 321
recover_recorded_responses("321", "321") ## outputs 321
recover_recorded_responses("123", "123") ## outputs 123
